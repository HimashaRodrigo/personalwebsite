              <p class="card-text small-font">Get ready to watch, remember, repeat! The Simon game is an exciting game of lights and sounds in which players must repeat random sequences of lights by pressing the colored lenses in the correct order.
                It's a fast-paced play, with lights and sounds that can challenge you.
                Experience the fun as you repeat the patterns and advance to higher levels.
                Keep track of your score as you challenge friends or try to beat your own high score.</p>

                  <li>Press any button to start the game. Simon will give the first signal. Repeat the signal by pressing the same color lens.</li>
                  <li>Simon will duplicate the first signal and add one. Repeat these two signals by pressing the same color lenses, in order.</li>
                  <li>Simon will duplicate these first two signals and add one.</li>
                  <li>Continue playing as long as you can repeat each sequence of signals correctly.</li>
                  <li>If you fail to repeat a sequence exactly, Simon responds with a "Warning" sound and a red light.
                    This means you've lost, and the sequence of signals ends.</li>
