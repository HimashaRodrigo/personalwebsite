              <p class="card-text small-font">A blog is a piece of written content that is published on a web page or site.
                The topics of blogs can vary from person to person or even business to business.
                The main purpose of blogs is to convey information in a way that
                is more informal or conversational than other long-form written content.</p>

                <h5 class="card-title card-headTitle">What is a Blog web application?</h5>
                <p class="card-text small-font">A blog web appication is a site that is updated with new information on an ongoing basis.
                  It normally consists of a collection of posts.
                Posts may be short, informal, controversial, or more professional. There are a couple of things that set a blog apart from a traditional website.
                The first is that blogs are updated consistently.
                Whether a brand updates their blog daily, weekly, or monthly, they will be putting new content up on the blog regularly for readers to engage with.
                With a traditional site, you may still find yourself updating content from time to time.
                But, for the most part, the content remains the same for longer periods of time.
                The other main difference between a blog and a traditional web application is that blog content encourages engagement.
